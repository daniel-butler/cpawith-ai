## The short version

I'm Daniel Butler. Former CPA. Software engineer at Amazon. Currently leading AI adoption across five engineering teams.

I spent six years in corporate accounting — month-end closes, reconciliations, the whole grind. Then I taught myself to code, applied to 847 jobs, and landed at Amazon as a software engineer.

Now I build AI systems for a living. And I think the thing I left behind — accounting — is exactly where AI can do the most good.

## Why this exists

Here's what I know from living on both sides:

**Accountants are already good at the hard part.** Describing a process clearly, step by step, with controls and validations — that's what SOX narratives are. That's what internal controls documentation is. That's what a well-written process memo is.

That skill translates directly into prompting an AI to build automation. Most accountants don't know that yet.

**Engineers don't understand accounting risk.** An AI can write a script that matches 98% of your bank transactions to your GL. An engineer looks at that and says "ship it." A CPA looks at that and asks: "What about the 2% it missed? What if one of those is a $400,000 wire that posted after cutoff?"

That judgment — knowing where the risk is — doesn't come from a Python tutorial. It comes from years of staring at trial balances that don't tie at 11pm on close night.

## What I'm not doing here

I'm not teaching you to code. I'm not going to walk you through Python syntax or explain what a variable is.

I'm teaching you to:

- **Describe your process** well enough that an AI can build the automation
- **Validate the output** — does the trial balance still balance? Do debits equal credits?
- **Spot the red flags** — where AI makes subtle mistakes that only an accountant would catch
- **Think about the system** — where does this fit in your workflow? What breaks if something upstream changes?
- **Push back** when the AI is wrong, and **be flexible** when its approach is different but actually better

You don't need to become a developer. You need to become a competent director of an AI that writes code for you.

## The credentials, if you care

- **Former CPA** — passed the exam, did the work, lived the close
- **Software engineer at Amazon** — building production systems, not side projects
- **Tiger team lead for AI systems** — currently rolling out AI adoption across five engineering teams at Amazon. I know what works, what doesn't, and what resistance looks like when organizations try to adopt AI.

That combination — accounting domain knowledge, engineering ability, and hands-on AI deployment experience — is what makes this site different from the other "AI for accountants" content out there.
